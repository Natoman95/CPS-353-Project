# Persistent issues

* Couldn't get widget-list to scale down all the way
* Couldn't get hamburgers and cogs next to each other widget-list
* The header text and glyphs aren't perfectly aligned
* Couldn't get the vertical line on website-new and website-edit
* Haven't commented anything yet
* Didn't have time to implement a great CSS class naming convention
* Haven't put different file types into directories
* Text doesn't scale much really, though forms and buttons change their behavior based on screen size
* Each HTML page has links and metas (is there a way to define these globally?)
* I didn't understand what the project meant when it said "Configure input field default text or values" as the text entered into the web pages is somewhat arbitrary and not always even visible
