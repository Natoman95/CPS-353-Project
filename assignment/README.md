# Persistent issues

* Couldn't get the vertical line on website-new and website-edit
* Haven't commented anything yet
* Didn't have time to implement a great CSS class naming convention
* Haven't put different file types into directories
* Each HTML page has links and metas (is there a way to define these globally?)
* footer and header class have duplicate code
